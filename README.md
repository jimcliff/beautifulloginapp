# Day Night Login

Made with üî• in India.

![Day Night Login Logo](https://github.com/shubhamhackz/day_night_login/blob/master/files/logo_updated.png)

This app is an implementation of the concept animated login design made by [Akshay Syal](https://www.uplabs.com/syalakshay) that is published on [Uplabs](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/day-night-login-interaction-freebie). He illustrated an amazing animated login design that can easily stagger anyone. When I came across this design it gave me goosebumps and made me restless to implement this design in flutter and finally I did it. You can use this as your login screen in any of your apps if you love to do.
